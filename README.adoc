= Awesome Data Tools
:toc:

A curated list of useful data-related tools to keep an eye on. 


[NOTE]
.My take after several years of working in big data
====
Computers are faster everyday. 
So for your simplicity's sake try to develop single-box applications
that can serve multiple users. 
Avoid distributed apps unless really needed.
====

## Databases

* sqlLite: SQL database without hassle. No need for external service since you are just using a library and a file. Good for enough of your needs unless you scale beyond multiple machines. https://highperformancesqlite.com/interviews/dhh[See DHH's take] 
* https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach[CockroachDB] distributed and resilient

### Queues (streaming)

* Redpanda: kafka alternative

### Key Value

* ScillaDB: cassandra alternative

### Search

* https://www.meilisearch.com/[Meilisearch]
* https://manticoresearch.com/[ManticoreSearch]: Elasticsearch alternative

## Processing

* Ibis: Run to multiple data processing backends using the same API

### Single node engines

* DuckDB: query TBs of data with its bigger-than-memory capabilities (tewaking might be needed)


### Distributed engines

* Apache Spark: trusted old software. Though you need a place to run it.
* https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow[Differential dataflow]: a different computation paradigm for real-time updates on data
* https://datafusion.apache.org/[DataFusion]
* Trino: distributed sql engine. Though maintaining its clusters can be challenging


## AI 

* https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/[LangChain] Develop apps that use LLMs
* https://www.langflow.org/[LangFlow] build agents and RAG applications in a visual way
* https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=dDVh3HV1cDJaUk57ViT7Zr[Gumloop] Automate your tasks with LLMs with lots of connectors (gmail, google calendar, drive...)

## Tools 

* poetry: for dependency management
* ruff: fast linting and code styler
* Pydantic: better dataclasses with schema validation
* FastAPI: Best api library on python. With automated docs and schema validation
* Typer: for cli applications 
* open-telemetry: standard observability library
* logfire: observability platform built by the pydantic team
